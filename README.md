# 🎵 Music Store Data Analysis (SQL Project)

This project involves analyzing a music store database using **SQL (PostgreSQL)**. The dataset includes tables such as customers, invoices, artists, albums, tracks, and employees.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights like customer behavior, music preferences, and regional trends by writing queries grouped into Easy, Moderate, and Advanced difficulty levels.
